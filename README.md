- **Configurable Playbooks**: Provides pre-defined Ansible playbooks that can be customized to suit various deployment scenarios and environments.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent setup across multiple nodes, maintaining uniform configurations and settings.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates easy scaling by automating the deployment process for multiple standalone nodes.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simplifies the update and maintenance processes through Ansible’s automation capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Ansible Helper for Standalone EpicChain Deployment, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Ansible**: Install Ansible on your control machine. Instructions can be found on the [Ansible Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
- **EpicChain Software**: Download the latest version of the EpicChain software from the [EpicChain GitHub repository](https://github.com/epicchainlabs/epicchain-node).
- **SSH Access**: Ensure SSH access to the target machines where EpicChain nodes will be deployed.
- **Operating System**: The tool supports major operating systems including Linux distributions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Begin by cloning the Ansible Helper repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epicchainlabs/ansible-helper-epicchain-deployment.git
   cd ansible-helper-epicchain-deployment
   ```

2. **Install Ansible Dependencies**:
   Install any required dependencies using Ansible’s package manager:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Inventory**:
   Edit the `inventory.ini` file to specify the target hosts for deployment. This file defines the machines where EpicChain nodes will be installed and configured. Example:
   ```ini
   [epicchain_nodes]
   node1.example.com
   node2.example.com
   ```

4. **Configure Playbooks**:
   Customize the Ansible playbooks to suit your deployment needs. Edit the `playbooks/deploy.yml` and other relevant files to configure parameters such as network settings, node roles, and data directories.

## Usage

1. **Deploy EpicChain Nodes**:
   Run the Ansible playbook to deploy and configure EpicChain nodes on the target machines:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   After deployment, verify the status and configuration of your EpicChain nodes. You can check the logs and node status on the target machines to ensure everything is running correctly.

3. **Update Configuration**:
   To update the configuration or make changes to the deployed nodes, modify the relevant playbooks and rerun the Ansible playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/update.yml
   ```

## Configuration

The configuration files are located in the `config` directory and include:

- **`inventory.ini`**: Defines the target machines for deployment.
- **`playbooks/deploy.yml`**: Contains the Ansible tasks for deploying EpicChain nodes.
- **`playbooks/update.yml`**: Used for updating and maintaining the deployed nodes.
- **`config/epicchain.yml`**: Configuration settings specific to EpicChain nodes.

Refer to the sample configuration files in the `config` directory for guidance on how to set up your own configurations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The Ansible Helper provides tools for ongoing monitoring and maintenance:

- **Monitor Node Status**:
  Check the status of your EpicChain nodes using system monitoring tools or by inspecting log files on the target machines.

- **Perform Updates**:
  Use the update playbook to apply updates or changes to your deployed nodes:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/update.yml
  ```

- **Backup Data**:
  Regularly back up your node data to prevent data loss. Implement backup procedures as required by your environment.
